**Author:** Rajat Saini

## What is Table Search & Filtering?
This feature allows users to search for specific data in tables and filter rows based on criteria. For example, you can search for all points with a specific name or filter rows by type.

### Key Concepts
- **Search:** Find rows containing specific text.
- **Filter:** Show only rows that meet certain conditions.
- **Dynamic Updates:** The table updates instantly as you type or select filters.

| Example: Search & Filter |
|--------------------------|
| Search: "Point"         |
| Filter: Type = Point     |

## Why is This Needed?
- Helps users quickly find relevant data.
- Makes large datasets easier to navigate.
- Enhances the user experience by providing dynamic interaction.

## How Does It Work in This Project?
- The frontend provides a search bar and filter dropdowns.
- Users enter text or select criteria to filter the table.
- The table updates to show matching rows.

## Dependencies
- **JavaScript** (for dynamic updates)
- **HTML/CSS** (for the table and controls)
- **GeoJSON files** (data source)

## Step-by-Step Usage Instructions
1. Open the app and upload a GeoJSON file.
2. Use the search bar above the table to find specific rows.
3. Use the filter dropdowns to narrow down the data.
4. Click on rows to highlight features on the map.

### Example: Searching for a Point
- Type "Point" in the search bar.
- The table shows only rows with "Point" in their data.
- Click a row to see the feature highlighted on the map.
