# Enhanced Zipcode Integration

**Author:** Rajat Saini

## What is Enhanced Zipcode Integration?
This feature improves routing by integrating detailed zipcode data, allowing users to plan routes based on zipcodes. It combines location data with routing algorithms for better accuracy.

### Key Concepts
- **Zipcode-Based Routing:** Uses zipcodes to define start and end points.
- **Data Integration:** Combines zipcode data with geographic coordinates.
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** Ensures precise routing based on location data.

| Example: Zipcode Routing |
|--------------------------|
| Zipcode A → Zipcode B   |

## Why is This Needed?
- Makes routing more user-friendly by allowing zipcode-based input.
- Ensures accurate routing by integrating location data.
- Demonstrates the combination of data integration and routing algorithms.

## How Does It Work in This Project?
- The user enters start and end zipcodes.
- The frontend sends these zipcodes to the backend via an API call.
- The backend retrieves location data for the zipcodes and calculates the route using QGIS.
- The frontend displays the route on the map.

## Dependencies
- **Leaflet.js** (for map interaction)
- **Flask** (for backend API)
- **MongoDB** (for storing zipcode data)
- **QGIS** (for route calculation)

## Step-by-Step Usage Instructions
1. Open the app and navigate to the zipcode input field.
2. Enter the start and end zipcodes.
3. Click the “Get Route” button.
4. The app calculates and displays the route based on the zipcodes.

### Example: Zipcode A to B Routing
- Enter Zipcode A as the start.
- Enter Zipcode B as the end.
- Click “Get Route.”
- The route is displayed on the map.

**Summary & Key Takeaways**
- Enhanced zipcode integration makes routing more user-friendly and accurate.
- It combines data integration with advanced routing algorithms.
- This feature demonstrates the power of combining data and algorithms for modern routing.
