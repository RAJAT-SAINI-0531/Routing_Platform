# Project Overview

**Author:** Rajat Saini

## What is This App?
This web application is a modern routing platform built with Flask (Python), Leaflet.js (JavaScript), and QGIS (Geospatial Processing). It helps users find optimal routes, visualize maps, and interact with geographic data—all in a browser.

### Main Technologies Used
- **Flask:** Backend web framework (Python)
- **Leaflet.js:** Interactive maps (JavaScript)
- **QGIS:** Geospatial analysis and routing
- **MongoDB:** Database for storing geographic data
- **Bootstrap:** UI styling
- **Docker:** Containerization for easy deployment

## Why is This Needed?
- Routing and mapping are essential for logistics, delivery, travel, and urban planning.
- This app makes complex GIS features accessible to beginners and non-GIS experts.
- Students can learn web development, mapping, and data handling in one project.

## How Does It Work?
- Users upload geographic data (GeoJSON files).
- The backend processes routes using QGIS algorithms.
- Results are displayed on interactive maps with tables and search features.
- All data is stored and managed in MongoDB.

## Key Features
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Interactive map with route visualization
- Attribute tables and search/filtering
- Multiple routing modes (point-to-point, round trip, multi-destination)
- Zipcode-based suggestions
- Dockerized deployment for easy setup

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Flask, Flask-Bootstrap, Flask-CORS
- Leaflet.js, Bootstrap
- QGIS (Python bindings)
- MongoDB
- Docker

## Try It Yourself
- Follow the next document to set up the app locally.
- Upload a sample GeoJSON file and see your data on the map!

**Summary & Key Takeaways**
- This app combines web, mapping, and data science in one project.
- You’ll learn how to build, run, and extend a real-world GIS platform.
- Each feature builds on the last—start with setup, then explore mapping and routing.
