# QGIS Processing Integration

**Author:** Rajat Saini

## What is QGIS Processing Integration?
This feature uses QGIS (Quantum GIS) to perform geospatial processing tasks, such as finding the shortest path between two points. QGIS provides powerful tools for analyzing and manipulating geographic data.

### Key Concepts
- **Shortest Path Algorithm:** Finds the quickest route between two points based on a road network.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Processes geographic data to extract meaningful insights.
- **Integration:** Combines QGIS with Flask to handle routing requests.

| Example: Shortest Path |
|------------------------|
| Start → Road Network → End |

## Why is This Needed?
- QGIS provides advanced geospatial capabilities that are hard to implement manually.
- It ensures accurate and efficient routing.
- Students learn how to integrate external tools into a web app.

## How Does It Work in This Project?
- The backend uses QGIS Python bindings to process GeoJSON data.
- When a user requests a route, QGIS calculates the shortest path.
- The result is sent back to the frontend for visualization.

## Dependencies
- **QGIS** (for geospatial processing)
- **Python bindings for QGIS** (to integrate with Flask)
- **GeoJSON files** (data source)

## Step-by-Step Usage Instructions
1. Install QGIS and its Python bindings (see setup docs).
2. Upload a GeoJSON file with your road network.
3. Request a route by selecting start and end points.
4. QGIS calculates the shortest path and returns the result.
5. View the route on the map.

### Example: Shortest Path Calculation
- Upload a road network GeoJSON file.
- Select two points on the map.
- The app calculates and displays the shortest path.

**Summary & Key Takeaways**
- QGIS adds powerful geospatial processing to the app.
- It handles complex tasks like shortest path calculation.
- Next, you’ll learn about basic point-to-point routing.
