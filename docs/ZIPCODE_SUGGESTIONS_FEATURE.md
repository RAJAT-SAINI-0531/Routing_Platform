# Zipcode Suggestions Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Zipcode Suggestions feature provides intelligent autocomplete functionality for zipcode inputs throughout the routing platform. When users enter a zipcode and press ENTER, they see suggestions in the format **ZIP + Street + County** sourced from the `unique_cluj.geojson` dataset.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Suggestions
- **Format**: ZIP + Street + County (e.g., "400253 - Strada Doinei nr. 27-69; 26-52, Cluj-Napoca")
- **Trigger**: Press ENTER after typing a zipcode
- **Source**: Real data from `data/unique_cluj.geojson`
- **Limit**: Up to 10 suggestions per query

### ðŸ”„ Multiple Selection (For Finish Zipcodes)
- **Stacked List**: Selected zipcodes appear as removable items below the input
- **Visual Design**: Each selection shows as a pill with an "Ã—" remove button
- **Input Handling**: Comma-separated values automatically managed
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing routing modules

### âš¡ Performance Optimized
- **Caching**: Search results cached for faster subsequent queries
- **Preprocessing**: Data optimized for search on module initialization
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, Enter, and Escape support
- **Smart Positioning**: Suggestions dropdown positioned relative to input

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
app/static/js/
â”œâ”€â”€ zipcodeSuggestions.js     # Main suggestions module
â”œâ”€â”€ form2Integration.js       # Updated to work with suggestions
â””â”€â”€ zipToZip.js              # Existing routing module (unchanged)

app/routes.py                 # Added data serving route
app/templates/index.html      # Added script inclusion
data/unique_cluj.geojson      # Source data file
```

### Integration Points

#### 1. Automatic Detection
The module automatically detects zipcode input fields by checking:
- Element is an `<input>` tag
- Has `data-type="zip"` attribute  
- Is within `.start-input` or `.end-input` containers

#### 2. Event Handling
```javascript
// ENTER key triggers suggestions
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    if (event.key === 'Enter' && this.isZipcodeInput(event.target)) {
        this.handleZipcodeEnter(event.target);
    }
});
```

#### 3. Data Source
- **Endpoint**: `/data/unique_cluj.geojson`
- **Format**: GeoJSON FeatureCollection
- **Properties Used**: `postcode`, `city`, `address`, `type`

### API Reference

#### ZipcodeSuggestions Module

**Main Methods:**
```javascript
// Initialize the module (auto-called on DOM ready)
ZipcodeSuggestions.init()

// Get selected zipcodes from an input (for integration)
ZipcodeSuggestions.getSelectedZipcodes(inputElement)

// Manually trigger suggestions for an input
ZipcodeSuggestions.handleZipcodeEnter(inputElement)
```

**Configuration:**
```javascript
ZipcodeSuggestions.config = {
    maxSuggestions: 10,           // Max suggestions to show
    minZipcodeLength: 3,          // Min characters to trigger search
    suggestionBoxClass: 'zipcode-suggestions',
    suggestionItemClass: 'suggestion-item',
    suggestionActiveClass: 'suggestion-active'
}
```

## Usage Guide

### For Users

1. **Basic Zipcode Entry:**
   - Select "Zipcode" option in any input field
   - Type a zipcode (e.g., `400253`)
   - Press **ENTER**
   - Select from the dropdown suggestions

2. **Multiple Destination Selection:**
   - For finish zipcode fields, each selected suggestion adds to a list
   - Remove selections by clicking the "Ã—" button
   - The system handles comma-separated values automatically

3. **Keyboard Navigation:**
   - **â†‘/â†“ Arrow Keys**: Navigate suggestions
   - **Enter**: Select highlighted suggestion
   - **Escape**: Close suggestions dropdown

### For Developers

#### Adding to New Forms
```javascript
// 1. Include the script
<script src="static/js/zipcodeSuggestions.js"></script>

// 2. Ensure proper input attributes
<input type="text" data-type="zip" placeholder="Enter zip code">

// 3. Place input in recognized container
<div class="start-input">
    <!-- zipcode input here -->
</div>
```

#### Getting Selected Values
```javascript
// For integration with routing modules
const selectedZipcodes = ZipcodeSuggestions.getSelectedZipcodes(inputElement);
// Returns: "400253, 400656, 407035" (comma-separated)
```

## Testing

- Real-time integration examples

### Test Cases

#### 1. Basic Functionality
```
Input: "400253" + ENTER
Expected: Shows suggestions including "400253 - Strada Doinei nr. 27-69; 26-52, Cluj-Napoca"
```

#### 2. Partial Matching
```
Input: "4002" + ENTER  
Expected: Shows all zipcodes starting with 4002
```

#### 3. Multiple Selection
```
Actions: 
1. Select suggestion "400253 - ..."
2. Clear input, type "400656" + ENTER
3. Select another suggestion
Expected: Both selections appear as stacked items
```

#### 4. Search by City
```
Input: "Cluj" + ENTER
Expected: Shows all zipcodes containing "Cluj" in city name
```

### Sample Test Zipcodes
- `400253` - Cluj-Napoca area
- `400656` - Cluj-Napoca area  
- `405100` - CÃ¢mpia Turzii
- `407035` - Apahida
- `400335` - Cluj-Napoca (Zorilor area)

## Integration with Existing Features

### Form 2 Integration
The `form2Integration.js` has been updated to work with the suggestions:

```javascript
// Updated to use suggestion-selected values
let endZips = '';
if (window.ZipcodeSuggestions && typeof window.ZipcodeSuggestions.getSelectedZipcodes === 'function') {
    endZips = window.ZipcodeSuggestions.getSelectedZipcodes(endInput);
} else {
    endZips = endInput.value.trim();
}
```

### Routing Compatibility
- **Multiple Destinations**: Works with comma-separated zipcode lists
- **Round Trip**: Compatible with waypoint selection
- **Mixed Routing**: Supports address-to-zipcode and zipcode-to-address routing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Suggestions Appearing**
   - Check browser console for data loading errors
   - Verify `/data/unique_cluj.geojson` endpoint is accessible
   - Ensure input has correct `data-type="zip"` attribute

2. **Styling Issues**
   - CSS styles are injected automatically by the module
   - Check for CSS conflicts with existing stylesheets
   - Verify `z-index` settings for dropdown positioning

3. **Multiple Selection Not Working**
   - Ensure input is within `.end-input` container
   - Check if input has proper event handlers attached
   - Verify selected zipcodes container is being created

### Debug Information

Enable detailed logging:
```javascript
// Check module status
console.log('ZipcodeSuggestions:', window.ZipcodeSuggestions);
console.log('Data loaded:', window.ZipcodeSuggestions.zipcodeData?.length);
console.log('Cache status:', window.ZipcodeSuggestions.suggestionCache.size);
```

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Full support (Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 11+)
- **ES6 Features**: Map, fetch, arrow functions, const/let
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to standard input behavior

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading
- **Initial Load**: ~2-3 seconds for full dataset (4000+ records)
- **Memory Usage**: ~5-10MB for preprocessed search data
- **Network**: Single request on page load, then cached

### Search Performance  
- **Preprocessing**: Search-optimized data structure created on load
- **Caching**: Results cached by search term for instant repeat searches
- **Throttling**: No artificial throttling - searches are fast enough

### Memory Management
- **Cache Limits**: LRU cache with reasonable size limits
- **Cleanup**: Event listeners properly managed
- **DOM**: Minimal DOM manipulation, efficient element reuse

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Fuzzy Search**: Handle typos and similar matches
2. **Geographic Proximity**: Sort results by distance from user location
3. **Custom Filtering**: Filter by zipcode type (village, city, etc.)
4. **Bulk Import**: Import zipcodes from text/CSV files
5. **History**: Remember recently used zipcodes

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Address Suggestions**: Extend to address autocomplete
2. **Map Integration**: Show zipcode boundaries on map selection
3. **Validation**: Real-time zipcode validation with visual feedback
4. **Analytics**: Track most-used zipcodes for optimization
